# Module-18-Challenge-PyChain-Ledger
Challenge: PyChain Ledger- In this Challenge, we're making updates to the enclosed Python file which contains the basic block chain-based ledger system.

### Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
 * Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the
 blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger
 will store.

### Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
 * Change the existing `Block` data class by replacing the generic `data`
 attribute with a `record` attribute that’s of type `Record`.

### Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
 * Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These
 input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record
 that you’ll store in the `PyChain` ledger.

### Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
* Test your complete `PyChain` ledger.
